# 🌳 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

🔗 LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/

---

## 📌 Problem Summary

Given the root of a binary tree, return its **maximum depth**.

Maximum depth = number of nodes on the longest path from root to a leaf.

---

## 🧠 Core Idea — Postorder Recursion

For each node:

depth = 1 + max(left depth, right depth)

Why?
- Left subtree has its own height
- Right subtree has its own height
- Take the bigger one and add current node

---

## ✅ Recursive Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDepth(TreeNode root) {

        if (root == null) return 0;

        int left = maxDepth(root.left);
        int right = maxDepth(root.right);

        return 1 + Math.max(left, right);
    }
}
